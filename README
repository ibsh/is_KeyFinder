# KeyFinder

KeyFinder is a tool designed to estimate the musical key of digital recordings, primarily to assist DJs in harmonic mixing. It is developed for Mac but aims to maintain compatibility with Windows. Some users have reported success in building it for Linux by downloading Mixxx, which uses the KeyFinder algorithm.
The goal is to estimate the musical key of digital audio recordings and can also aid DJs in harmonic mixing for seamless transitions between tracks. This is meant to be a fast work tool that avoids downloading any external libraries, which ensures efficiency and ease of use. 

KeyFinder began as my final project submission during an MSc in Computer Science at Birkbeck, University of London. My project report, which documents its algorithms in detail, is available along with a binary download at www.ibrahimshaath.co.uk/keyfinder
